    "# The Mel Scale:\n",
    "The human ear doesn't perceive sound frequency lineary: at high frequencies, we need larger differences to notice a change.\n",
    "That's why we use the Mel scale, to compress high frequencies and to stretch low ones and get an approximation of this sound percepetion, thanks to the logarithmic fatcor.\n",
    "$$Mel(f)=2595\\cdot\\log_{10}(1+\\frac{f}{700}) \\qquad\\textrm{(approximately)}   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why, instead of using raw waveforms or spectograms, we convert audio into **Mel spectrograms** or **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).**"
